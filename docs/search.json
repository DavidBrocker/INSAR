An understanding of these relations is crucial for the development of precise\nand ecologically valid social intervention programs for autistic youth.\nObjectives: To examine the relations between emotion recognition, mental state\nunderstanding, and ecologically valid measures of social behavior in a sample of autistic\nand non-autistic youth.\nMethods: One hundred and sixty-seven autistic (n= 86) and non-autistic (n= 81) youth\ncompleted standardized emotion recognition, Theory of Mind (ToM), and peer\ninteraction tasks (Table 1). Sociometric-ratings by peers were collected in the\nclassroom. Autism symptom levels were assessed using the Autism Diagnostic\nObservation Schedule (ADOS-2; Lord et al., 2012). Correlations between intra-individual\nvariables (emotion recognition, ToM) and social outcomes (autism symptom level, peer\ninteraction behaviors, sociometric-ratings) were examined.\nResults: In the autistic sample, facial emotion recognition (r=.23, p&lt;.05) and vocal\nemotion recognition (r=.33, p&lt;.01) correlated with autism symptom severity. ToM\ncorrelated with autism symptom severity at a similar magnitude (r=-.24, p&lt;.05).\nMeanwhile, facial emotion recognition (r=-.25, p&lt;.05) correlated with positive peer\ninteraction during unstructured interaction with greater verbal demands; vocal emotion\nrecognition (r=.25, p&lt;.05) correlated with low-level peer interaction during this same\ntask. ToM correlated m or e s t r on gl y with positive interaction (r=.32, p&lt;.01) during this\nsame task. Of these tasks, only ToM correlated with more over al l positive behavior\nacross all tasks (r=.25, p&lt;.05), but with f ewer reciprocated friendships in the classroom\n(r=-.56, p&lt;.05).\nFor the non-autistic sample, comparative strength and direction of relations was mixed.\nRelation to autism symptom severity was in the same direction and similar in size for\nfacial emotion recognition (r=.29, p&lt;.01), but nonsignificant for vocal emotion\nrecognition (r=.12, p=.29). However, facial and vocal emotion recognition (both r&gt;.40,\np&lt;.001) showed positive correlations (i.e., more errors, more of this specific type of\ninteraction) with n e g a t i ve peer interaction during unstructured interaction with greater\nverbal demands, but n e g a t i ve correlations (i.e., more errors, l e s s of this type of\ninteraction) with low-level peer interaction (both r&lt;-.26, p&lt;.05) during fully unstructured\npeer interaction. Vocal emotion recognition correlated positively (i.e., more errors,\nmore of this type of interaction) with positive peer interaction (r=.29, p&lt;.05) during this\nsame task. Notably, ToM exhibited a nonsignificant relationship with all social outcomes\nin this sample.\n\n\n\nTable 1\nFigure 1.
