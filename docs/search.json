    "text": "Background\n\nResearch has begun to characterize the relations between intra-individual and “real word” outcomes for autistic and non-autistic adults (Morrison et al. 2020).\nHowever, very little research has directly linked these levels of analysis for autistic youth.\nAn understanding of these relations is crucial for the development of precise and ecologically valid social intervention programs for autistic youth.\n\n\n\nObjective\nTo examine the relations between emotion recognition, mental state understanding, and ecologically valid measures of social behavior in a sample of autistic and non-autistic youth.\n\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\n\n\nMethod\n\nAutism feature levels were assessed using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2), (Lord et al. 2012) Comparison Score (CS), (Gotham, Pickles, and Lord 2009; Hus and Lord 2014)\nFacial emotion recognition (FER) and vocal emotion recognition (VER) were measured using the Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy, volume 2 (DANVA-2) (Nowicki and Duke 2008).\nTheory of Mind (ToM) was assessed using the SELWeb measure of social cognition (Russo-Ponsaran et al. 2019).\nProportion of reciprocated friendships was measured using peer-rated sociometric procedures (Coie, Dodge, and Coppotelli 1982) administered by primary teachers in a classroom setting.\nPositive, negative, and low-level peer interaction behaviors were measured by trained coders following a peer interaction assessment (McNair et al. 2023).\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\nFigure 1.
