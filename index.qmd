# Background

-   Research has begun to characterize the **relations between intra-individual and "real word" outcomes** for autistic and non-autistic adults [@morrison2020].

-   However, very little research has **directly linked these levels of analysis** *for autistic youth**.***

-   An understanding of these relations is crucial for the development of precise and ecologically valid social intervention programs for autistic youth.

# Objective

To examine the relations between emotion recognition, mental
state understanding, and ecologically valid measures of social
behavior in a sample of autistic and non-autistic youth.

# Method	

-   **Autism feature levels** were assessed using the Autism
    Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2), [@lord2012]
    Comparison Score (CS), [@gotham2009; @hus2014]
    							

-   **Facial emotion recognition (FER)** and **vocal emotion
    recognition (VER)** were measured using the Diagnostic
    Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy, volume 2 (DANVA-2)
    [@nowicki2008].
    							

-   **Theory of Mind (ToM)** was assessed using the SELWeb
    measure of social cognition [@russo-ponsaran2019].
    							

-   Proportion of **reciprocated friendships** was measured
    using peer-rated sociometric procedures [@coie1982]
    administered by primary teachers in a classroom setting.						

-   **Positive, negative, and low-level peer interaction
    behaviors** were measured by trained coders following a peer
    interaction assessment [@mcnair2023].

# Conclusions				

-   Results suggest a more **complex and subtle relationship
    between emotion recognition, mental state
    understanding, and social outcomes** than has been previously
    reported, and **which differs between autistic and non-
    autistic youth**.					

-   While **emotion recognition** (particularly vocal) correlated with
    social outcomes more strongly for some outcome measures, the
    overall pattern of effects suggest that **ToM** (mental state
    understanding) **was more consistently related to outcomes
    across measures in the autistic sample**, albeit not always in a
    positive direction.

-   **Present findings** not only better elucidate the relation between
    intra-individual variables and “real world” social outcomes for
    autistic youth, but also **identify promising targets for the
    development of individualized social intervention
    programs.**
